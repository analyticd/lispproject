** Description
Create Common Lisp project template. Run ./lispproject.sh to generate a usage message (or see Usage section below).
** Usage
Make the lispproject.sh script executable if needed: ```chmod +x lispproject.sh```

Run the script:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./lispproject.sh name-of-project directory-within-which-project-directory-should-be-created
#+END_SRC
*** Note
lispproject.sh will create your name-of-project directory inside of your
directory-within-which-project-directory-should-be-created directory and
automatically edit all source files to use your name-of-project as the name of
the project. Your directory-within-which-project-directory-should-be-created
directory will also be created if it doesn't yet exist.
